Dice Roll Project
Overview
The Dice Roll project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that simulates rolling dice. It features two types of dice: Black and Gold. Users can select a dice type by clicking on its preview image, and then roll the dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The application visually shuffles the dice images and displays the final result.

Features
Dice Selection: Click on the preview images of Black or Gold dice to select the dice type.
Dice Rolling: Click the "Roll Dice" button to shuffle the dice images and display the final result.
Visual Shuffle: The application shows a quick shuffle effect by cycling through dice images before revealing the final roll.
How It Works
Loading Images: The application loads images of dice faces from two folders: one for Black dice and one for Gold dice. Each folder contains images representing dice faces numbered 1 through 6.

Image Resizing: Images are resized and padded to fit specific dimensions for previews and final output.

Dice Selection: Users select a dice type by clicking on the respective preview image. The current dice type is set based on this selection.

Rolling Dice: When the "Roll Dice" button is clicked, the application simulates a rolling effect. It rapidly cycles through dice images for a brief period before displaying the final dice face.
